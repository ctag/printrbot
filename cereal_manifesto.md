# The Cereally 3D Manifesto

### Education Takes A Community

I like public education; I feel that it is necessary for future proofed communities. That said, my experience is that the greatest return per participation investment lies with Hands On participation in clubs run by general community members. 

Phrasing this point is somewhat daunting, but I wish to express a desire for more general community participation in curricular and extracurricular activities. Students should never feel that they would love to explore 'x' topic.. if only it was offered.

### Every Teacher Matters

I can recall the events leading up to my real commitment to computing and its accessories. A middle school enrichment teacher noticed that I was attempting to build my own desktop computer from spare parts at a thift store. She encouraged me to complete the project, and when I was ready to try building an even better computer, donated components to the cause. That computer is still in use today, and it runs the public presentations at the Von Braun Astronomical Society's Planetarium on Monte Sano Mountain every Saturday evening.

Every student needs a different mentor or cheerleader to instagate hobbies that compliment contemporary schooling and provide investigation that may well develop into serious career goals. Teachers are the go-to for this incubating environment, but to do this at the highest level possible they need access to resources, recognition from their community, adequate wages. This quickly becomes an unstable topic for me, as I'm conflicted by the notion of tenure, which I hold responsible for some of the disgusting practices deemed acceptable at my university. Please see the contact information below, and keep this conversation active to help me better understand my own point of view here.

### Hands On Initiative, Utility and Application

I am SICK of the "21st century schooling" leeching from educational campuses. It is appalling that schools will strictly waste funding on devices which, while niche or handy, provide little to absolutely no educational value. Uniformity on this level should be eschewed, and the ever-marching onslaught of brand new teaching tools should be only considered and purchased for an educator who finds it utilitous and beneficial.

The Hands On Initiative means that the bragging right of having a "SmartBoard" in every classroom comes _after_ the basic resources needed by teachers to conduct class. Students should have access to materials they can manipulate independantly to learn. This is unlike a lab in that strucure is absent and lab reports are only kept when a student finds them necessary.

I need to sit back and take a calmer approach to this section. TODO:
discuss math posters with lists of applications for types of mathematics.
