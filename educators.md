### Hello

Dear Educators of Madison City Schools,

Hi, I'm Christopher Bero, a recent graduate from MCS. 

### Cereally 3D

I am pleased to present my ongoing project: Cereally 3D. For the past several weeks I have designed and begun construction on an adaptation to the popular consumer-grade Printrbot Simple Metal. 

3D Plastics Printers are fun and all, but they still lack serious technological advancements that are necessary for them to be ultimately useful in home and consumer applications. Namely, printing currently requires a person present to chip a part off of the hotbed after printing. This means that printers are limited to printing only as long as a person is around to set up for the next item to be printed.

My Cereally 3D kit will allow the printer to run semi-unattended, which means that the cost of printing is drastically reduced, since no person is required to move the finished part and prepare for the next. There will still be botched prints, jams, filament changeovers and the like, but ultimately the printer will be able to produce more items in 24 hours with less overhead.

Once the public webpage for the printer is online, I would like to formally extend use of the printer to all Madison City educators. For free.

The website interface will hopefully allow remote printing, all that will be necessary is a .stl file to upload. The printer will then slice the object model, print it, and then we can work out how to get it to you.

### Curriculum

As part of this outreach, I want to develop a boilerplate curriculum for your use. Please help me find resources that will accentuate a class module for student 3d printing access.

### Contact Me

I would like to hear from you! Everything's important, from overarching discussions on PLA vs ABS plastic filaments to use, to typos on this website; send it my way!
